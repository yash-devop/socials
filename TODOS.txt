@sophiadev doesnt exist


even though sophia is signedIN

so , instead of @sophiadev doesnt exist  , just show the Sophia Johnson and other UI part , follow 
and display "NO POST"

and also if @sophiadev2 is not created but search through the url like @sophiadev2 , then display directly @sophiadev doesnt exist instead of the whole UI.

REFER this : /api/[id]  

user {
  profilepic: {
    public_id: 'thread_images/gcev4q0hjzhfaiacwnlf',
    url: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/djomu8i9v/image/upload/v1690302240/thread_images/gcev4q0hjzhfaiacwnlf.jpg'
  },
  _id: new ObjectId("64bff71cf5b9aeeb081600a6"),
  fullname: 'Sophia Johnson',
  username: 'sophiadev',
  password: '$2a$10$JkKXYJAg/sY9GKBDzQDjMOOA/LXCWg3AJVShdK.s6WqhS7UwTpsnK',
  __v: 0
}

When @ethan ? then  response contains => array of data => [data is here]
when @sophiadev ? then response contains => empty array => []
